Google assistant with Dialogflow


Google Assistant is the virtual assistant that's found on smartphones, homes, and a host of other devices. It's the application that takes in voice commands and completes tasks based on user input.

Actions on Google is the developer platform that allows you to build applications for Google Assistant. This is going to be the central console for conversational application development.

Google Assistant is a personal voice assistant that offers a host of actions and integrations. From sending texts and setting reminders, to ordering coffee and playing your favorite songs, the 1 million+ actions available suit a wide range of voice command needs. Google Assistant is offered on Android and iOS, but it can even be integrated with other devices like smartwatches, Google Homes, and Android TVs.

As we know, Actions is the central platform for developing Google Assistant applications. Actions work with a number of human-computer interaction suites, which simplifies conversational app development. Out of all the platforms, the most popular is Dialogflow, which uses an underlying machine learning (ML) and natural language understanding (NLU) schema to build rich Assistant applications.

This small project will get hands-on practice with Actions and Dialogflow by building an Assistant application that generates quotes when prompted by a user. I  will gain practical knowledge of computer-human interaction suites and by the end of this lab, I  will have successfully built a fully-fledged Google Assistant application.
